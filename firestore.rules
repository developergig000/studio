/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a Database-based Access Control (DBAC) model.
 * A user's role, stored directly on their profile document, dictates their permissions.
 * Specifically, 'HEAD_SALES' users are granted read access across all user profiles,
 * while standard 'SALES' users can only access their own data. All authenticated
 * users are permitted to create and manage their own profile document.
 *
 * Data Structure: A single top-level collection `/users/{userId}` stores all user
 * profile data. The document ID `{userId}` corresponds to the user's Firebase
 * Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing: Listing all users is a privileged operation restricted to users with
 *   the 'HEAD_SALES' role. An exception is made to allow checking for the existence
 *   of any user to enable client-side seeding logic.
 * - Authorization Independence: The user's `role` is denormalized directly onto their
 *   `/users/{userId}` document. This allows security rules to check a user's role
 *   with a single `get()` operation against their own profile, making permissions
 *   clear and performant.
 * - Self-Service Profile: Users are empowered to create their own user document upon
 *   first sign-in and manage it thereafter. Writes are strictly confined to a user's
 *   own document.
 * - Admin User Creation & Management: 'HEAD_SALES' users are permitted to create new user documents
 *   for others and update any user's profile, which is necessary for the User Management feature.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The `role` field on each `/users/{userId}`
 * document is a critical piece of denormalized data. It allows the `isHeadSales()`
 * function to efficiently determine the requesting user's permissions without needing
 * to consult other collections or rely on custom claims.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Not applicable, as this model uses a single collection with
 * role-based permissions to manage access, which is appropriate for this use case.
