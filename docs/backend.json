    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure secure and efficient data access based on user roles (SALES and HEAD_SALES). The core principle is Authorization Independence, achieved by storing the `role` directly within the `users/{uid}` document. This avoids the need for `get()` calls in security rules to fetch the user's role, making operations atomic and easier to debug. The structure also addresses the need for role-based filtering of user data, where a HEAD_SALES user needs to read all users, but a SALES user can only read their own document. Since a path-based approach is adopted, only one collection is used. This approach leverages the DBAC (Database-based Access Control) principle, where roles are stored in the database itself rather than using custom claims."
